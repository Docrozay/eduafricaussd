# Welcome to Game Of Learners Season 2 
# Our project is based of the USSD Technology called "EduAfrica"
## Inspiration
We were moved by the number of children who are eager to go to school but have no access to education. especially with the rise of e-learning platforms due to the pandemic more children couldn't access formal education. So we have focused on building an e-USSD service that can be connected to an e-learning platform.
## What it does
We have created a USSD service that is connected to an e-learning platform. Student can be able to
1. Register on the platform.
2. Change language (English and Swahili)
3. Receive bit-sized lectures
4. Share attendance
5. Answer quizzes and trivial.

## How we built it
We build it using Africa'sTalking USSD API service.

## Challenges we ran into
Our challenges are as follows:
1. Learning curve with Africa's talking API
2. Teammates availability
3. Dealing with errors from API

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are happy that
1. The USSD service is working and can be demoed
2. USSD service can connect to an e-learning database.

## What we learned
We have learned how to work with APIs, Azure DevOps, and Team collaboration 

## What's next for EduAfrica
We would like to continue integrating the USSD service into an e-learning platform
